simulation of numbers in pi 
Yesterday I thought to develop a program that simulates the behavior of successive numbers in "pi" since the succession of these numbers is more or less random using python and library turtle I wrote a script that has the following principle: if the number is:
0: draw a vertical line upwards
1: we turn 36 degrees to the right and draw a line from the point where we stop  ... I also give color codes to its numbers to better observe the figure. The program script is not very complicated but it takes time to generate the pi number when it is 100000 digits after the commas or even more and of course the tracing in these cases.
